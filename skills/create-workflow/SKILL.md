  INVOKE THIS SKILL IMMEDIATELY when user asks to: write/create/build a Nextflow pipeline or workflow,
  create any bioinformatics pipeline (RNA-seq, DNA-seq, variant calling, ChIP-seq, etc.),
  or compose/chain Nextflow modules (process or workflow modules) from the Nextflow Registry. This skill handles all Nextflow workflow creation tasks.

# Nextflow Workflow Writer

Create complete Nextflow workflows by composing validated modules from the [Nextflow Registry](https://registry.nextflow.io).

Modules are published under namespaces (e.g. `nf-core/fastqc`), and these skills compose modules from any of them.

**Requires Nextflow 26.04 or later** (for the `nextflow module` commands used during validation). Including workflow modules requires **Nextflow 26.10 or later**.

Registry modules come in two kinds (shown as `Kind:` by `nextflow module view`):
- **Process modules** — one tool, e.g. `nf-core/star/align`
- **Workflow modules** — a reusable subworkflow chaining several modules, e.g. `nf-core/fastq_align_star` (STAR alignment + samtools sort/index/stats)

**NEVER write a wrapper workflow just to run/test a single module.**

❌ **WRONG** - Writing a workflow to run one module:
```groovy
// DO NOT DO THIS - not even when a module run fails!
include { FASTQC } from 'nf-core/fastqc'
workflow { FASTQC(Channel.fromPath('data/*.fq.gz')) }
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Use the `run-module` skill:
```
Skill(skill="run-module")
```

**The `run-module` skill:**
- Uses `nextflow module search/view` to discover and get proper inputs/parameters
- Runs modules directly via `nextflow module run <namespace>/<module>`
- No wrapper workflow needed

**⚠️ When a module run fails due to missing args:**
- DO NOT write a wrapper workflow as a "fix"
- Instead: run `nextflow module view <module>` to get correct parameters
- Fix the command-line arguments and re-run directly

**Only write a workflow in Step 4** when composing multiple validated modules together.

## 4-Step Workflow Creation Process

**ALWAYS follow this structured process when creating a new workflow:**

### Step 1: Identify Modules and Propose Plan

1. Use `nextflow module search <term>` to find Registry modules for each processing step
2. **Look for workflow modules** that already cover a chain of steps. `nextflow module search` rarely ranks them high enough to appear, so query the registry API with the `kind=Workflow` filter:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://registry.nextflow.io/api/v1/modules?query=align%20reads%20STAR&kind=Workflow&limit=10" \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(r["name"], "-", r["description"]) for r in json.load(sys.stdin)["results"]]'
   ```
   When a workflow module matches a chain of steps in the plan, use it instead of hand-wiring the same process modules.
3. Use `nextflow module view <name>` to understand inputs/outputs of each module (for a workflow module: its `take:` inputs in call order and its `emit:` outputs)
4. **Present a plan to the user** with:
   - List of identified modules, marking each as process or workflow module
   - Processing sequence (which module runs first, second, etc.)
   - Data flow between modules (outputs → inputs)

**STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 2: User Agreement

- Wait for user to review and approve the proposed plan
- Address any questions or modifications requested
- Only proceed when user explicitly agrees

### Step 3: Validate Modules ONE BY ONE (MANDATORY)

**NEVER skip this step.** After user agreement:

1. Determine appropriate **test data** for validation
2. For EACH module in the plan, sequentially:
   - **Install and run with test data**: Invoke `Skill(skill="run-module")`
   - **Verify outputs** - confirm expected data is produced
   - Only proceed to next module after current one succeeds
   - **Untyped workflow modules** (most nf-core ones) fail `nextflow module run` with "cannot be executed directly because it is not typed". This is expected, not a failure to fix: do NOT write a wrapper workflow for it, and do not stop to ask the user. Record it in the validation log as "validated in Step 4" and move on. It gets validated by the end-to-end run in Step 4.
3. Log ALL module run commands and their outputs to a debug file with the `.modules-validation-` prefix
4. If a command fails, stop and show the user the command used and the output generated before trying something else

> **Note**: The `run-module` skill uses `nextflow module` commands for discovery, configuration, and execution — modules are installed on-the-fly.

**DO NOT proceed to Step 4 until ALL modules have been individually validated.**

### Step 4: Compose Final Workflow

Only after ALL modules run successfully:

1. Configure `nextflow.config` with Wave + Conda:
   ```groovy
   wave.enabled = true
   wave.strategy = 'conda,container'
   docker.enabled = true
   ```

2. Write the workflow script compositing all validated steps using **Nextflow managed modules** (no `./` prefix — Nextflow automatically downloads and installs them from the Nextflow Registry):
   ```groovy
   include { MODULE_A } from 'nf-core/module_a'
   include { MODULE_B } from 'nf-core/module_b'

   workflow {
       MODULE_A(input_ch)
       MODULE_B(MODULE_A.out.results)
   }
   ```

   Workflow modules use the same include syntax (`include { FASTQ_ALIGN_STAR } from 'nf-core/fastq_align_star'`) and are called with positional arguments in their `take:` order, as listed by `nextflow module view`. For untyped workflow modules, the input descriptions from `nextflow module view` are approximate. Read the installed `modules/<namespace>/<name>/main.nf` to see which process each input feeds, and build the channel shape that process expects (e.g. `[meta, index]` tuples). On first run, Nextflow installs each one under `modules/<namespace>/<name>/` together with its dependencies in a nested `modules/` directory. Commit the `modules/` directory with the pipeline.

3. **Run the complete workflow using the same test data** to validate end-to-end. This is the validation step for any untyped workflow module skipped in Step 3.

## Critical Guidelines

### Command Execution
- Use `-resume` flag to leverage cached results when appropriate
- Use absolute paths, never relative paths

### File Handling
- When specifying multiple files, separate with comma and wrap in double quotes: `--input "file1.fq,file2.fq"`
- ALWAYS expand wildcards/globs to comma-separated file lists before running
- Reference task IDs from stdout to locate output files in work directories

### Module Include Syntax
- `include { MOD } from 'nf-core/module'` — **Nextflow managed module** (default). Nextflow automatically downloads and installs it from the Nextflow Registry. Always prefer this form. (`nf-core` here is the namespace; substitute the actual namespace of the module you are using.)
- `include { MOD } from './modules/nf-core/module/main.nf'` — **Local file path**, resolved against the working directory. Only use when referencing locally modified modules.

### Module Selection
- Prefer an existing workflow module over hand-wiring the process modules it already chains together
- Find workflow modules via the registry API `kind=Workflow` filter (see Step 1); `nextflow module search` rarely surfaces them
- Do not write wrapper workflows to test single modules - use `Skill(skill="run-module")` instead
- Use `nextflow module search` to find modules, then `nextflow module view` for details

### Debugging Protocol
1. Check the task work directory using the task ID from stdout
2. Examine `.command.log`, `.command.err`, and `.command.out` files
3. Verify input files exist and are accessible
4. Check resource requirements (memory, CPUs) match available resources

## Skill Delegation (IMPORTANT)

**Delegate module-specific tasks to specialized skills using the `Skill` tool:**

| Task | Invoke Skill |
|------|--------------|
| Install/run/test a module | `Skill(skill="run-module")` |

### When to Delegate

- **Step 3 (Validate Modules)**: Use `run-module` skill for each module validation

### Example: Step 3 Validation

For each module in your plan:
```
1. Invoke: Skill(skill="run-module") → install, run with test data, and verify outputs
2. Only proceed to next module after success
```

These skills contain detailed instructions for their specific tasks and ensure consistent execution patterns.

## Quick Reference

```
Step 1: Identify process + workflow modules → Propose plan to user
Step 2: Wait for user agreement
Step 3: Validate ALL modules ONE BY ONE with test data (untyped workflow modules: defer to Step 4)
Step 4: Compose final workflow (only after Step 3 succeeds)
```
